# Vector Product
This repository contains a Python script that calculates the addition, subtraction, cross product and dot product of two 3D vectors. The script prompts the user to enter the components of the vectors and then computes the addition, subtraction, cross product and dot product using the entered values.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run the script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python.org.

You also need to install the colorama library, which is used for terminal color output. You can install it via pip:

`
pip install colorama
`

### Usage
#### Clone the repository to your local machine:

`
git clone https://github.com/UniquePython/Vector-Product.git
`

#### Navigate to the directory:

`
cd Vector-Product
`

#### Run the script:

`
python vector_product.py
`

Follow the prompts to enter the components of the two vectors.

The script will output the addition, subtraction, cross product and dot product of the two vectors.
